Hi I'm Tryston, weclome to my website! I'm a gameplay and tools programmer that's passionate about crafting new expeirences through games! I love game programming because I get to work with so many other talented individuals and create logical solutions to creative problems every day, like in my most recent project [Grimhook](/grimhook).

<!-- Since moving to dallas for my Computer Science Degree at UTD, I've been involved in many game dev communities, predominantly I've been an officer of the [Student Game Developer Association (SGDA)](https://utdsgda.club) at UTD, currently sitting as President. I'm also involved with IDGA's Dallas Chapter, Game Dev Drink-ups, and [Society of Play](https://societyofplay.net/), so be sure to say hi if you see me around! -->
