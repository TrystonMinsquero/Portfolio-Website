# Portfolio Website

This is my personal website I made for showing my games and projects, in addition to learning the basics of full-stack web development. The goal was to make a website where I can easily add and edit projects within this GitHub repository to update my website.

A big thank you to [Rik Ghosh](https://github.com/RikGhosh487) for helping me with a lot of the frontend, he had done most of the CSS and frontend JavaScript applications. In addition to guiding me on what technologies to use and miscellaneous work.

## How I made it

Originally it was a node app deployed in heroku, but after they removed their free dynos, I made a static site generator that gets deployed with firebase.
