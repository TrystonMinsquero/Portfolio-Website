        Grimhook was originally for <a href="https://itch.io/jam/spring23-jam">SGDA's Spring 2023 game jam</a>, and as it was the last jam for SGDA I'll do, I knew I wanted to give it my all. This was also the first complete game
        that I worked in Unreal in and was a great way to get a better grasp of the engine. We had a pretty small team, where everyone was doing a whole department, which I was responsible for all of the programming. After the jam
        was over, we all wanted to keep working on the game and hope to release it on steam in the coming months. In this page I'll give a
        deep dive into how I implemented everything. As this project is still in progress, I will have found better ways to do certain things so much of this content is likely going to change.

        <h2>Character Controller</h2>
        <p>I started with the first person character controller that comes with Unreal 5 which helped out a lot, so I already had basic walking, collision, gravity, and jumping day one.
            This let me I had already started prototyping the way the grapple would work to get comfortable with how to approach it.
