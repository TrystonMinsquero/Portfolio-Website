    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>
        Grimhook was originally for <a href="https://itch.io/jam/spring23-jam">SGDA's Spring 2023 game jam</a>, but after the praise and how much we liked the game we decied we would keep working on it.
        Nine months later and a lot of work we finally finished a demo that we put on steam and it achieved overwhelming positive reviews <a href=/grimhook/steam>on steam</a>.
        I was the only programmer during the game jam and in the final product <b>I programmed nearly every feature</b> using a mix of c++ and blueprints.
        <!-- In this page I will be going more in-depth on my process and approach for some aspects of the project, I will not be able to give full source code as we are hopefully going to keep working on and sell in the future. -->

        I plan on doing a full breakdown in the future, but since we are still developing this title and is planned on being sold and I can't show any of the code publicly.
        If you would like to know more how I implmented any of the mechanics or systems, please feel free to reach out through any means and I'd love to talk about it.

        <h2>Character Controller</h2>
        <p>I started with the first person character controller that comes with Unreal 5 which helped out a lot, so I already had basic walking, collision, gravity, and jumping day one.
