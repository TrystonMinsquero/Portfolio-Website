# Astrolothree

### Role

Programmer, Game Designer, and Project Lead

### Team

Dylan T Moss, Jonica Brooks, Silvano Gallegos

## Background

We made Astrothree for a week long [game jam hosted by SGDA](https://itch.io/jam/sgda-spring-jam) during the spring semester of 2021 with the theme: "Rule of Three". The team consisted of my roommate and two people that I had never met, and it was all done virtually. I was the only one with prior game development experience and ended up leading the team. Additionally, this was my first time working with an artist and another programmer.

## Summary

We ended up making a top down wave based survival-arcade game, where the player has 3 forms and each form is more or less effective against different enemy forms. It also takes advantage of a free high-score api to keep track of high-scores over the internet.

## What I Contributed

-   Came up with the original idea for the game
-   Created player input controls
-   The high-score system implementation and scene
-   Implement unity's 2D light renderer and post processing (especially seen with bloom)
-   Created an emission map for the character sprite-sheet
-   Created the wave-based gameplay system
-   All sounds effects
-   Distributed tasks to other team members

## Challenges faced

As stated before, I was the only who had previous experience, so delegating tasks and making sure things are being completed in a good order took more time than expected. My teammates did amazing and I also contributed a lot, but having school during the week and also people having jobs didn't allow us to get as much done as I would've hoped for. Since many of them have never used Unity or made a game before, trying to guide them also took some time. For example, the character animation for attacking has a very small attack range, which made implementing gameplay fairly difficult.

## What I Learned

I learned how nice it was to have a competent team who's skills are diverse and how important it is to communicate with them to have a good product. I also learned a lot about unity, from 2D lights and graphics to how _not_ to organize code in a unity project. Although we got it to work, going to look back at the code does not seem like a good time. In addition I learned more about Coroutines and many other aspects about C# in Unity.

## What I'm Most Proud of

Getting the bloom to work and also the online high-score system to work I think really impressed the judges to where we won a prize for "Best Technical". Additionally I think this is one of the best looking games in terms of graphics I have made.
