## Summary

KillSwitch is a top-down multiplayer arcade shooter where your health is time. The only way to get it back is taking over other NPC's or your friends! Make sure you have a good weapon to defend yourself too. This game was designed to play with up to 7 other friends and does not support single player, that being said, you can join by yourself but it just won't be very exciting.

## Background

This game was another for a week long [game jam hosted by SGDA](https://itch.io/jam/sgda-fall-2021-jam) during the fall semester of 2021 and the theme for the jam was "Memento Mori" which translates to "remember you must die". The team consisted of some friends I had made in SGDA and other projects, and it was all done virtually. This was the first _in-person_ game jam I had done so I really wanted to make a local multiplayer and the rest of my team agreed.

The jam went well, but I felt like the game had a lot of potential that was not explored in the jam. I tried to get some of the team and bring on a few others to work on it after the jam, but after multiple weeks where I was the only person contributing, I decided to move onto other things. I had fixed a lot of bugs and cleaned up the code so maybe one day I will come back to this project.

## What I contributed

-   Essentially all of the code, if I did not write it, I fixed it.
-   Gameplay concept and design
-   Project management

## Challenges faced

-   During the jam I was in the process of moving into my apartment.
-   Many members had school or work and could not contribute as much as they would have liked too.
    -   This led to having scope creep on myself as I thought I would be working with more people
-   Having a solid local multiplayer system with a lobby
-   Creating a system to take over other players and NPCs, changing sprites and weapons during runtime and making fluid movement

## What I Learned

I gained lots of knowledge on how unity's Input system worked, Animation override controllers, scriptable objects, and much more. This was the first time I had _somewhat successfully_ made a large complex system with lots of moving parts. It was extremely difficult to conceptualize and do in a week, and gave me more appreciation for software design, especially in C#/Unity.
