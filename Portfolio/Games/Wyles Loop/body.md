## Summary
This was the first game I made in unity, as well as the first game jam entry and first time working with another person. It was made for Ludum Dare in 3 days with barely knowing much about Unity or C#. It's not very flashy and the controls and gameplay are a little clunky, but I was proud of what I was able to learn and make within a few days. However, I was still intrigued with the potential solutions to fix the game so I decided to try to fix a lot of the major problems and explore new features.

## What I contributed
* Player Controls
* All art except for main character
* Sound Effects
* High-score system (after jam)


## Challenges faced
Not knowing unity or C# was a big difficulty, I had made a game before in python using pygame before which helped me with the physics for the player movement, but still was a major obstacle. Also I was unfamiliar with github at the time and used unity cloud system as a version control.

## What I Learned
I learned a lot about how Unity works and the basics of switch to C# from Java. Also how to manage my time to have a finished product in a limited time frame. And the more technical skills, making a video game and how to upload it to the web as well as learning how to implement a high-score system in my Unity project (after jam). This was also really important for me to realize I could make just about anything I wanted with enough time from youtube tutorials and applications what I've learned in school.
