# Portfolio Website

### Team

Rik Ghosh

## Summary

This is my personal website I made for showing my games and projects, in addition to learning the basics of full-stack web development. The goal was to make a website where I can easily add and edit projects within this GitHub repository to update my website. You can read more about how I made it in the [Github Readme](https://github.com/TrystonMinsquero/Portfolio-Website#ReadMe).

## What I learned

I finally developed good foundations for web development that I was severely lacking. I can say I can build a web app from scratch and have my own server I experiment with. I created and solved my own problems using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This lets me feel more confident using these languages. I also became more familiar with github and working together, as previously I would just use the main branch and nothing else. I started to learn the fundamentals of creating and merging branches and making issues. This project introduced me to web development and opened a whole new world of possibilities as I had never considered.
